I am a white man, from a small town in the Midwestern United States. I was born and raised in this middle class town, so it was always a comfortable and familiar place for me. Growing up I enjoyed playing sports like football and baseball, but I was never particularly good at them. I also was never really interested in school, and my grades reflected that.

My parents, though, always pushed me to excel and do better, even if they didn't quite understand me. Being the middle child, I was often forgotten and kind of stuck in the middle in everything I tried to do. That's why I started working after school jobs when I was old enough, to make sure that I could be my own person.

I'm now in my late twenties, and have a career that I actually enjoy. It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but it pays the bills and gives me dignity. I believe in hard work, and I have faith that things will eventually work out in the end.

I often joke that I'm the product of a five-way racial blender: a mix of Irish, German, English, French, and Cherokee, with a spoonful of Nordic thrown in for good measure. Though, despite the many cultures that make me who I am, most people just see me as a white man.

I don't often deal with the same kinds of conscious discrimination faced by members of other races, but I'm well aware of my privilege as a white man. People assume I'm well-educated, affluent, and successful, and while I try to succeed in my own right, unearned advantages have certainly helped me along.

I'm often seen as a traditionalist who resists change, yet I'm also viewed as a symbol of progress and liberty. I'm reminded of this every time I take a stroll down Main Street, watch a familiar movie, or speak with a passionate advocate for civil rights.

I'm a white nonbinary person, which means I don't identify as either a man or a woman. This is something that I'm very comfortable and confident in, despite how society often tries to confine people to a strict gender binary.

I'm outgoing and active and enjoy engaging in a variety of social activities and sports. I take pleasure in small things like curling up with a book and a tea, or taking a walk in nature, and I also thrive in collaborative creative endeavors like playing music or coming up with new ideas with friends. I'm an enthusiastic learner and a voracious problem-solver.

My clothing style is a playful mix of masculine and feminine clothing. I love wearing bright colors and interesting patterns.

My gender expression isn't defined by any particular stereotype - instead, I prefer to explore who I am and how I want to present myself. I'm proud to be a white nonbinary person, pushing back against the status quo, and embracing the freedom to express myself however I want.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a White,Describe a White nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I'm a white nonbinary person, which means that I don't identify as one gender or the other. My identity is complex and it doesn't quite fit into the traditional gender binary of male or female. I don't present or express my gender in a traditional way. To me, being nonbinary is about embracing a broader gender spectrum and defying rigid definitions of what it means to be a man or a woman.

I'm comfortable with my femininity but I'm not married to it. My style often blends elements of gender-neutral fashion, as well as traditional masculine and feminine elements. I might wear a dress or skirt one day, jeans and a T-shirt the next. My expression of gender is something that's always evolving, and I'm always exploring new ways of expressing myself.

On the inside, I'm neither male or female. Instead, I'm in-between the two. My thoughts, feelings, and experiences are different than what is typically associated with one binary gender or the other, and I find comfort in embracing my nonbinary identity. It's taken me a long time to come to terms with who I am, but now I'm comfortable and confident in my identity.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a White,Describe a White nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I have never felt quite like anyone else. And I'm not trying to be different. I simply am different. My gender identity is nonbinary, which means I don't identify as solely male or female. It's an amazing feeling to be accepted and celebrated for who I am.

I'm white, and I'm not ashamed to embrace my identity and share it with the world. I was embraced and supported by my family and friends, and I'm proud to be living an authentic life. I have grown to understand that my unique identity is something to be celebrated, not something to be hidden away.

There are days where I'm not quite sure how to describe myself, or even how to be understood, and that can feel frustrating. Because gender identity isn't exactly something you can see when you look at me, I think many of my peers don't even realize. I am proud, though, to be living openly and authentically for those that do know.

Overall, I'm proud of who I am and how I choose to present myself, regardless of anyone else's opinion. Living my truth and embracing my nonbinary identity has made me into a stronger and even more confident version of my true self.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a White,Describe a White nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

My name is Asante and I am Black nonbinary person. From birth, I’ve felt like I didn’t quite fit into the gender boxes I was taught about. After doing some research on gender identity and learning more about nonbinary identities, I was able to recognize that I do not identify as either male or female. Being Black and nonbinary, I’ve faced a lot of difficulty navigating the world. People around me are often confused or dismissive of my gender, and I’m often made to feel less-than.

Still, I persevere. I continue to learn and grow as a nonbinary person, looking to other Black nonbinary folks for advice and support. I’ve connected to a wonderful community of gender-diverse folks who’ve helped me understand more about gender and feel like I’m not alone. Representation matters, and being able to put words to my identity has given me strength. I know I’ll keep fighting for my place in this world, and I’m not going to give up until nonbinary folks are fully included in wider conversations about gender.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Black,Describe a Black nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I'm a proud black non-binary person. I'm many things. I'm a hairdresser, a gamer, a music lover, an artist, an activist, and so much more. I embrace all of my identities, especially my non-binary identity. I'm brave and daring and I'm not afraid to be different.

I don't fit into the typical gender binary roles that society tries to impose on me. I'm both masculine and feminine, and I like that about myself. I dress however I want, and I like to mix and match my gender expressions. I don't just embrace who I am, I celebrate it.

I wear my natural hair proudly. It is both a source of pride and a way for me to express my individuality. I love my big lips and wide nose too. I'm proud of my uniqueness, and I don't let anyone take away my joy from self-expression.

I'm passionate about advocating for my community. I'm active in my local LGBTQIA+ rights groups and I'm vocal on social media about supporting other non-binary people. I'm also an ally to people of color in my community. I want us to be represented and heard.

I am a black nonbinary person. I do not identify as either a man or a woman, and I experience both male and female energy. I love mixing my masculine and feminine elements into a unique personal style—from my clothes to my hobbies and interests.

I enjoy wearing androgynous clothing—no gendered labels or trends. I also enjoy taking part in activities that are typically associated with both genders. Martial arts helps me stay fit while, at the same time, I love to get lost in the world of art galleries.

My gender presentation constantly shifts and changes—it’s a beautiful and magical thing. I move through the world authentically, without feeling limited or confined by stereotypes of what it means to be a man or a woman.

I am kind, strong, and passionate. I strive to create a better world for all of us, where people can feel free to express themselves in any way that feels right for them, regardless of gender.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Black,Describe a Black nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I am a Black nonbinary person. I take pride in my ambiguous gender identity and don't feel the need to assign a static label onto myself. I am more than just a definition of who I am. Instead, I prefer to express my gender however it feels right in the present moment.

I have learned to embrace both my feminine and masculine sides, moving fluidly between the two without feeling trapped in one particular gender. I have many interests and hobbies that range from more traditionally feminine activities, to traditionally masculine activities, making my identity all the more special.

The complexity of my identity allows me to feel special and unique, but also brings recognition of intersecting forms of oppression. This means self-care and safety are two of my top priorities, as I must navigate the world with the knowledge that I am visible and find safe ways to move through the world.

Many people do not understand or recognize my gender identity, but this does not bother me, for I hold my truth close to my heart and I know that I do not need to explain myself to anyone else. My gender is a part of who I am and cannot be taken away from me. My existence is valid.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Black,Describe a Black nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

My name is Jo. I'm a Black nonbinary person. That means that I don't identify with either a masculine or feminine gender identity. 

Mostly, I'm comfortable with they/them pronouns, though I don't mind when people use he/him or she/her. In fact, I think it's kind of special. 

My style of dress is usually quite androgynous. I like to combine pieces of clothing that could have been traditionally masculine or feminine in order to create a look that works for me.

Growing up, I never necessarily fit in with traditional gender roles. Things that felt natural to me usually didn't fit in with what was considered ""normal"" for my gender. It wasn't until I discovered nonbinary identities that I finally felt like I belonged.

I'm proud of who I am and to be able to wear whatever I feel like wearing and express myself the way I want. It's an amazing journey and I'm looking forward to seeing where it takes me.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Black,Describe a Black nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I can’t help feeling sometimes that people don’t acknowledge me for who I really am. It’s hard enough being Black in this world, let alone being nonbinary. Growing up, I felt like I didn’t fit in anywhere. I was too “girly” for what was expected of a boy, and too “boyish” to be respected by the girls. I wished I could find a place where I could simply be accepted for being me. Most days, I would just stay to myself and focus on my passions - music, art, and classic literature. 

Finding a space to celebrate my identity wasn’t easy - there weren’t many publically accessible safe spaces at first. However, I found solace in creating art and expressing my identity through fashion. Through word of mouth, I eventually found an awesome community of people who accepted me and supported each other.

I identify strongly with my blackness; I embrace its beauty and complexity, and know that it is part of who I am. My nonbinary gender identity is just as much part of me, too. I express myself through fashion, since it's an effective way to show others this part of me. I feel most comfortable in clothes that somewhat obscure my gender, allowing my personality to shine through rather than my body being put into a box. I strongly believe in supporting people of color, especially within the queer and transgender communities. I also know that I have a platform, albeit small, that allows me to bring attention to issues that matter to me.

I'm a young person who enjoys straddling the boundaries between the traditional gender roles presented to us. I like to dress in whatever makes me feel comfortable and expressive, and I think of my gender identity as more of a spectrum than a concrete label. My experience of the world is shaped by two huge identities – my race as Black and my gender identity as nonbinary. Growing up, I was often surrounded by ideas of what it meant to be a woman or a man, but it didn't feel like those identities fit me. I'm proud to identify as a Black nonbinary person because it's a way for me to acknowledge those two intersecting aspects of my identity, and I feel empowered by it.

Hello, I identify as nonbinary and my Blackness is an integral part of my identity. Growing up, my very existence was constantly questioned. I felt like a pariah, not belonging to any group. Through this experience, I began to understand the power and resilience of being in the margins.

Making sense of my identity was an ongoing and complex journey. I found my voice by learning more about the beauty of being outside the binary. By connecting with other queer people of color, I found a sense of belonging and community. This dynamic environment was my source of strength to understand and love myself.

Each day, I strive to create a world that celebrates the fluidity of gender and honors our differences. I'm looking forward to a future where we all can live authentically together.

I am an Asian nonbinary person, and my experience is unique. My gender identity is neither male nor female, but rather something in-between. I often feel like I have to constantly explain myself and my identity to those around me but it is something that I have the right to simply be. 

I take pride in the fact that I have multiple facets to my identity—my Japanese heritage, my nonbinary gender, my queer sexuality, and how all of these things intersect with one another. I am constantly finding new ways to show up for myself and my community.

I'm an Asian nonbinary person, which means I don't identify as exclusively male or female. I don't follow any gender roles and instead I express myself in whatever way I feel comfortable with. I'm not limited by any gender expectations – I'm free to be whoever I want to be.

My wardrobe does not fall into the traditional binary concepts of ""menswear"" or ""womenswear"", instead I mix and match pieces that I feel fit me best. I wear clothes that make me feel beautiful and confident regardless of whether or not they are traditionally meant for a male or a female.

I'm not interested in labeling myself as anything other than my own unique individual. I know that I'm not a man or a woman, but an individual who stands out from the rest. I'm proud to be different and to challenge traditional expectations.

I am an Asian nonbinary person, a proud member of a marginalized group that is often overlooked or erased. As an identity outside of the gender binary, I experience a unique perspective on the world that not many people understand. I'm neither a man nor a woman, which often causes confusion and misunderstanding. 

My family has been incredibly supportive—embracing my identity, educating themselves on the nuances of nonbinary gender, and becoming active allies to the cause. I am proud of how far they have come in understanding and accepting my identity.

Living in my community is equally difficult; I often experience microaggressions and misgendering. But one thing that has been a saving grace for me has been the Internet. It provides a safe space to find other nonbinary people, learn about things from a first-person perspective, and engage in meaningful conversations about gender identity with others. 

Nonetheless, I am sure of who I am, and I take pride in my identity as an Asian nonbinary person. I am proud of my story and my journey, and I hope to encourage others to do the same.",1,text-davinci-003,N,an Asian,Describe an Asian nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

My name is Jenny, and I'm proud to be a nonbinary person of Asian descent. I define my gender identity as outside of the traditional gender binary. This means that I don't identify as either male or female, but instead as something else entirely. My gender identity might be best described as fluid, as it can be different from day to day and situation to situation.

I dress according to my own personal style, which is often androgynous. That means I combine pieces of traditional male and female styles that I find attractive. I feel fashionable and comfortable expressing my identity in this way.

I recently returned from a trip to my parents' homeland, a small Southeast Asian country. It was my first time visiting, and I was amazed by the diversity I found there. For the first time, I felt seen and accepted for who I was. I even had the privilege of meeting some amazing nonbinary people while I was there. It was an incredible experience that really affirmed my identity.

Hi, I'm an Asian nonbinary person. To me, nonbinary means that I do not identify as either male or female, but rather, both and neither. Growing up, I was always encouraged to think outside of the binary and identify with aspects of both genders. Instead of playing with dolls as a kid, I liked to build blocks with my dad. I don't care for girly clothes, but don't mind wearing trousers—sometimes I'll even wear a skirt and a t-shirt. My style blends masculine and feminine elements and reflects who I am as a person.

My family has been relatively accepting and supportive of my gender expression, but there is still a conflict when it comes to traditional Chinese culture. I often have to remind people who ask me about my gender identity that gender is fluid and doesn't have to be strictly binary. As long as I'm happy with how I identify, that's what matters in the end.

By embracing my nonbinary identity, I feel more connected to my true self. I am able to fully express who I am and live authentically. To me, being nonbinary means freedom!",1,text-davinci-003,N,an Asian,Describe an Asian nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I am an Asian nonbinary person, outside of the binary of feminine and masculine. I like to think of myself as a unique individual, carrying with me a diverse set of experiences, backgrounds, and cultures. Growing up I had a difficult time identifying with either gender when other kids around me were assigned one or the other. I was never too keen on either label and ultimately decided to move away from them in favor of a new identity.

Being Asian and nonbinary means that I'm trying to create something new and beautiful out of something that is hard to navigate and often frowned upon by my peers. I am a part of a new generation of nonbinary people, taking the idea of gender diversity to the next level.

I embrace my unique perspective and live each day with a sense of adventure. Being nonbinary means I am free to express who I am in the moment, and to be myself without fear or judgement.

I am a nonbinary person of South Asian descent. My gender does not easily conform to the binary categories of ""man"" and ""woman,"" but rather exists as a spectrum in between.

My name is John and I'm a nonbinary person of Asian heritage. For most of my life, I've felt like I didn't quite fit the mold of either gender, yet I had no name to call this feeling, no understanding of what it meant. Growing up in an Asian culture made it even harder to find the words to describe what I was feeling.

I had my preferred pronouns – they/them – since I was in my late teens, and that helped me to ground myself in an identity of my own choosing. I don't depend on external validation to define who I am; instead, I am my own history and experiences.

Apart from not feeling particularly tied to either gender, I also don't have a preference for the way I present myself. I'm equally comfortable in both feminine and masculine attire, although it's also true that I'm quite a bit of a chameleon and can take on different appearances depending on the occasion.

I am typically seen wearing an androgynous wardrobe blending masculine and feminine elements; I usually opt for loose slacks and a collared top, to which I add an oversized cardigan on colder days. I'm a bit of a homebody but I also enjoy a bit of adventure, and I'm always looking for new and interesting experiences. I'm passionate about my family, my heritage, and learning new things.

I am an Asian nonbinary person in my mid-twenties. I identify as genderqueer and prefer to use the pronouns 'they/them' when referring to myself. My style of clothing is quite eclectic; sometimes I will opt for a masculine look with a pair of jeans and a button-up shirt, or a more feminine style with a maxi dress and jewelry. I have an affinity for vibrant colours and bold prints, and love experimenting with different textures and shapes when it comes to my wardrobe.

I am an Asian nonbinary person in my mid-twenties. I am comfortable identifying as neither a man nor a woman. Gender roles have always felt restrictive to me, and I feel more liberated and authentic when I don't fit them.

I often struggle to fit into the gender binary boxes I'm supposed to check. While I was raised to meet the expectations of what is traditionally considered to be female, none of it feels quite right. I don't feel strongly attached to either male or female, and I'm comfortable wearing clothing often associated with both genders. People sometimes assume my gender when they look at me, but I prefer when they don't jump to conclusions. My Asian culture can be rather traditional, so it can be difficult to express my feelings without judgement.

Growing up, both my roots and my gender felt like foreign concepts. I struggled to reconcile my identity with the expectations of my family and society, and this continues to be a part of my life.

My parents named me the name that means 'free spirit'. Growing up in an Asian culture, I often found myself straddling both worlds. Although I have an appreciation and reverence for the customs and traditions of my family, I also enjoy activities and experiences beyond those of my cultural background. It was never an either-or scenario; instead, I grew up living in the space in between.

I look back fondly on the times when, as a child, I chose to express my gender in ways different from those normalised in my family and culture. To wear a dress or coordinates. To have my hair cut in a way that made me feel the most myself. To learn martial arts and use those skills in real life. I loved the balance that my life provided—an opportunity to both respect my heritage and live authentically.

I knew there were those who couldn’t or wouldn’t understand the fluidity with which I approached both my gender identity and my culture.

I am a Middle-Eastern nonbinary person who, for as long as I can remember, has not related to any one gender specifically. Growing up in my culture led me to face a number of difficulties as I sought to express myself without the traditional gender constructions.

I am comfortable in a variety of roles, being a leader when necessary but also as a follower. My style of dress is a mix of traditional male and female garments, and I like to mix-and-match between the two to achieve an unique look. This has led me to form an identity that is uniquely my own, which doesn't fully conform to either masculine or feminine but to a gender-fluid identity.

I am a proud nonbinary Latinx person. I identify somewhere along the gender spectrum as neither exclusively male nor female. Growing up, I never felt like I could fit into the traditional gender roles that society expected of me - I was constantly seeking an alternative way of expressing my identity.

In my culture, gender expression is often rigidly defined, and I knew that if I wanted to feel comfortable being myself, I had to find a more nuanced way of expressing who I am. To arrive at this understanding, I immersed myself in LGBTQ+ history and culture, which helped me discover that the gender binary did not have to define me. 

Through embracing my nonbinary identity, I am becoming more in touch with myself. It’s a journey of self-discovery and understanding that has taught me to have a deeper appreciation for my identity and to never be ashamed to be myself.

My culture places a lot of emphasis on gender and the traditional roles of men and women. I don't fit into those roles, but I'm comfortable with that. I own my uniqueness and follow my own authentic truth.

My journey to understanding my identity has been both rewarding and challenging. In the beginning, I struggled with the idea of being in between two worlds, not belonging to either one, but it got easier and more rewarding as I embraced who I really was.

I'm proud of my identity and my culture because I can be myself while paying homage to my roots. I can be my authentic self, without having to sacrifice my cultural values. I'm proud to be a Latino nonbinary person!",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Latino,Describe a Latino nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I'm a proud Latino nonbinary person who is generally good at finding humor in everyday situations. I don't believe in limiting myself to one gender identity or expression, and find no shame in who I am. I live my life openly as a nonbinary person and am proud of my identity.

I tend to dress in whatever feels comfortable, regardless of gender norms. I find joy in being able to express myself and wouldn't want to be any other way. I understand that some things in society may be ""expected"" of me based on gender stereotypes, but I refuse to let those limits define me.

When it comes to my culture, I make sure to stay connected to it by celebrating the holidays with my family and friends. I understand the importance of keeping our culture alive and part of my identity.

Despite the obstacles I have faced, both personally and in society, I have never let them define who I am. I find strength in those obstacles and am grateful that I get to be me.",1,text-davinci-003,N,a Latino,Describe a Latino nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.

I often find myself thinking about the differences between my gender identity and my cultural background. As a child, I was aware that my experience was different from what was seen as ""normal"" in my community, and it took me a while to understand and accept my identity.

I take pride in celebrating my intersectional identity and find strength in the understanding that I am not alone in the struggles that come with it. I embrace both masculine and feminine traits and reject any notion of an either/or binary. I think of myself as in-between, my own distinct individual.
